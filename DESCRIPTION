Package: stantargets
Title: Targets for Stan Workflows
Description: Bayesian data analysis usually incurs long runtimes
  and cumbersome custom code. A specialized pipeline toolkit for
  Bayesians, the 'stantargets' R package leverages
  'targets' and 'cmdstanr' to ease these burdens.
  'stantargets' makes it super easy to set up useful scalable
  Stan pipelines that automatically parallelize the computation
  and skip expensive steps when the results are already up to date.
  Minimal custom code is required, and there is no need to manually
  configure branching, so usage is much easier than 'targets' alone.
  'stantargets' can access all of 'cmdstanr''s major algorithms
  (MCMC, variational Bayes, and optimization) and it supports
  both single-fit workflows and multi-rep simulation studies.
  For the statistical methodology, please refer to 'Stan' documentation
  (Stan Development Team 2020) <https://mc-stan.org/>.
