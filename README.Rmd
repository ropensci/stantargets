Bayesian data analysis usually incurs long runtimes and cumbersome custom code, and the process of prototyping and deploying custom [Stan](https://mc-stan.org) models can become a daunting software engineering challenge. To ease this burden, the `stantargets` R package creates [Stan](https://mc-stan.org) pipelines that are concise, efficient, scalable, and tailored to the needs of Bayesian statisticians. Leveraging [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/), `stantargets` pipelines automatically parallelize the computation and skip expensive steps when the results are already up to date. Minimal custom user-side code is required, and there is no need to manually configure branching, so `stantargets` is easier to use than [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) and [`CmdStanR`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) directly. `stantargets` can access all of [`cmdstanr`](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr)'s major algorithms (MCMC, variational Bayes, and optimization) and it supports both single-fit workflows and multi-rep simulation studies.

## Prerequisites

1. The [prerequisites of the `targets` R package](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/index.html#prerequisites).
1. Basic familiarity with [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/): watch minutes 7 through 40 of [this video](https://youtu.be/Gqn7Xn4d5NI?t=439), then read [this chapter](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html) of the [user manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/).
1. Familiarity with Bayesian Statistics and [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/). Prior knowledge of [`cmdstanr`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) helps.

## How to get started

Read the `stantargets` [introduction](https://docs.ropensci.org/stantargets/articles/introduction.html) and [simulation](https://docs.ropensci.org/stantargets/articles/simulation.html) vignettes, and use <https://docs.ropensci.org/stantargets/> as a reference while constructing your own workflows. Visit <https://github.com/wlandau/stantargets-example-validation> for an example project based on the [simulation vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/stantargets/articles/simulation.html). The example has an [RStudio Cloud workspace](https://rstudio.cloud/project/2466069) which allows you to run the project in a web browser.

## Installation

Install the GitHub development version to access the latest features and patches.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ropensci/stantargets")
```

The [CmdStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan) command line interface is also required.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

If you have problems installing [CmdStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan), please consult the [installation guide of `cmdstanr`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html) and the [installation guide of CmdStan](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_26/cmdstan-guide/cmdstan-installation.html). Alternatively, the [Stan discourse](https://discourse.mc-stan.org) is a friendly place to ask Stan experts for help.

## Usage

First, write a [`_targets.R` file](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html) that loads your packages, defines a function to generate [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) data, and lists a pipeline of targets. The target list can call target factories like [`tar_stan_mcmc()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/stantargets/reference/tar_stan_mcmc.html) as well as ordinary targets with [`tar_target()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_target.html). The following minimal example is simple enough to contain entirely within the `_targets.R` file, but for larger projects, you may wish to store functions in separate files as in the [`targets-stan`](https://github.com/wlandau/targets-stan) example.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# _targets.R
library(targets)
library(stantargets)

generate_data <- function() {
  true_beta <- stats::rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1)
  x <- seq(from = -1, to = 1, length.out = n)
  y <- stats::rnorm(n, x * true_beta, 1)
  list(n = n, x = x, y = y, true_beta = true_beta)
}

list(
  tar_stan_mcmc(
    name = example,
    stan_files = "x.stan",
    data = generate_data()
  )
)
```

Run [`tar_visnetwork()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_visnetwork.html) to check `_targets.R` for correctness, then call [`tar_make()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_make.html) to run the pipeline. Access the results using [`tar_read()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_read.html), e.g. `tar_read(example_summary_x)`. Visit the [introductory vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/stantargets/articles/introduction.html) to read more about this example.

## How it works behind the scenes

`stantargets` supports specialized [target factories](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/02/03/targets/#target-factories) that create ensembles of [target objects](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/reference/tar_target.html) for [`cmdstanr`](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr) workflows. These [target factories](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/02/03/targets/#target-factories) abstract away the details of [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) and [`cmdstanr`](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr) and make both packages easier to use. For details, please read the [introductory vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/stantargets/articles/introduction.html).

## Help

If you have trouble using `stantargets`, you can ask for help in the [GitHub discussions forum](https://github.com/ropensci/stantargets/discussions/categories/help). Because the purpose of `stantargets` is to combine [`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) and [`cmdstanr`](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr), your issue may have something to do with one of the latter two packages, a [dependency of `targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/blob/4e3ef2a6c986f558a25e544416f480fc01236b6b/DESCRIPTION#L49-L88), or [Stan](https://mc-stan.org) itself. When you troubleshoot, peel back as many layers as possible to isolate the problem. For example, if the issue comes from [`cmdstanr`](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr), create a [reproducible example](https://reprex.tidyverse.org) that directly invokes [`cmdstanr`](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr) without invoking `stantargets`. The GitHub discussion and issue forums of those packages, as well as the [Stan discourse](https://discourse.mc-stan.org), are great resources.
